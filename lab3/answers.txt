sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort has the fastest omega compare to it BigO and when i tested it in random.txt
(worst situation) and sorted.txt (best situation) i realized that it has 6sec as omega and comapre to it
BigO it was OMEGA(n).

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: so i knew that in reversed.txt; Merge sort should be faster than Selection sort so i tested
sort2 and sort3 and i saw that sort2 takes 4sec but sort3 takes 7sec. as i said sort2 is faster then sort2
is Merge sort

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: so i knew that in reversed.txt; Selection sort should be slower than Merge sort so i tested
sort2 and sort3 and i saw that sort2 takes 4sec but sort3 takes 7sec. as i said sort3 is slower then sort3
